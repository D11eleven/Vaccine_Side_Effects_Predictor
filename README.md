## Background 

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was created by the FDA and CDC to receive reports about adverse events that may be associated with 
vaccinations world wide, including the COVID-19 vaccines. Physicians and vaccine providers are encouraged to report adverse events after a vaccination.

## Inspiration 

How can we support individuals to understand what side effects they may experience from a Covid Vaccination based on vaccine manufacturer, their age, prior 
allergies, medical history and gender.  Create a model to predict the possible side effects in the categories of_ Mild, Moderate, or Severe._
